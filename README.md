Baleen casts a wide net for interesting links on twitter. It follows the people that the people you follow follow, and shows you the stories that everyone's talking about.

This project owes a major conceptual debt to the Nieman Journalism Lab's [Fuego](http://www.niemanlab.org/2013/07/introducing-openfuego-your-very-own-heat-seeking-twitter-bot/).
